## Introduction

This section explains **who** this policy applies to and **when** it comes into play.  
By the end, you'll know whether your device, application, or role needs to follow a certain standard or practice.

## Roles

### All Employees - The First Line of Defense

At CARA COM MY, every team member is part of our security shield.  
If something unusual happens — like a suspicious email, strange system behavior, or even the faintest hint of a data breach — it's everyone's responsibility to alert the MIS team.

Think of it this way: cybersecurity isn't just an “IT thing”; it's a company-wide team sport, and every player matters.

### Server Administrators - The Gatekeepers

For our Server Admins, the policy becomes relevant when provisioning or maintaining infrastructure.  
This includes moments like:

- Deploying a new VM
- Assigning network addresses
- Managing firewalls or access controls
- Handling server patches and upgrades

<Tip>In short, whenever servers touch the network, policies apply.</Tip>

### Developers - The Builders

For Developers, security standards come into play throughout the software lifecycle, such as:

- Choosing or creating repositories for projects
- Deciding on the branching strategy
- Setting up CI/CD pipelines
- Deploying applications into staging or production
- Installing software packages on servers
- Managing dependencies and third-party libraries
- Handling sensitive credentials or API keys

<Tip>
  In other words, if code leaves your local machine, these policies matter.
</Tip>

### Others

This policy may also extend to:

- **Project Managers**, when deciding on tools or platforms for the team
- **Vendors/Contractors**, when integrating with our systems
- **Interns/Temporary Staff**, whenever they are given access to company data or devices

## Summary

This section sets the stage: who the policy applies to and when it should be followed.
