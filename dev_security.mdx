This policy defines the security requirements for the software development lifecycle.
Key principles include:

- **Secure Coding Practices:**
    - Developers must follow secure coding best practices to prevent common vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP Top 10).
    - Code must be reviewed for security vulnerabilities before being deployed to production.
- **Dependency Management:**
    - All third-party dependencies must be scanned for known vulnerabilities.
    - A process must be in place to update dependencies with known vulnerabilities.
- **Secrets Management:**
    - All secrets (e.g., API keys, passwords) must be stored in a secure secrets management solution.
    - Secrets must not be hardcoded in the source code.
- **CI/CD Security:**
    - The CI/CD pipeline must be secured to prevent unauthorized access and code injection.
    - All code must be scanned for vulnerabilities as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
