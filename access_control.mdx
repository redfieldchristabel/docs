## Introduction

This section outlines the framework for granting, managing, and revoking access to company systems and data, ensuring that all access is secure and appropriate.

<Note>
  This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third parties who require access to company resources.
</Note>

## Access Management Process

### 1. Requesting Access

<Note>Applies to: All Employees</Note>

All requests for new access or changes to existing access must be submitted through the official IT ticketing system.

<Steps>
<Step title="Submit a Ticket">
  - Navigate to [it-support.company.com](https://it-support.company.com).
  - Fill out the "New Access Request" form.
  - Provide a clear business justification for the required access.
</Step>
<Step title="Manager Approval">
  Your manager will be automatically notified to approve the request.
</Step>
<Step title="System Owner Approval">
  Once your manager approves, the relevant system owner will review and approve the request.
</Step>
<Step title="Access Provisioning">
  The IT team will provision the access once all approvals are received.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  All requests, approvals, and provisioning actions are logged for auditing purposes.

### 2. Core Principles in Practice

These are the core principles that guide our access control decisions.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Least Privilege (PoLP)" icon="user-shield">
  **What it means:** You only get the minimum access required to do your job. Access is denied by default.
  **In practice:** When you request access, be specific about what you need and why. Don't ask for broad permissions.
</Card>
<Card title="Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)" icon="users">
  **What it means:** Permissions are assigned to roles (e.g., "Developer," "HR Manager"), not individuals.
  **In practice:** Your access is determined by your job role. This simplifies management and ensures consistency.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### 3. Privileged Access Management (PAM)

<Note>Applies to: System Administrators and other privileged users</Note>

Access to privileged accounts (e.g., administrator, root) is strictly controlled.

- Use of privileged accounts is logged and monitored.
- Shared privileged accounts are prohibited; use your own named admin account.
- Privileged access should be granted on a temporary, as-needed basis where possible.

<Warning>
  With great power comes great responsibility. Handle privileged access with extreme care.
</Warning>

### 4. Regular Access Reviews

<Note>Applies to: Managers and System Owners</Note>

To ensure access remains appropriate, regular reviews are conducted.

- **Managers:** You are responsible for reviewing your team's access rights quarterly. You will receive an automated notification to start the review process.
- **System Owners:** You are responsible for reviewing who has access to your systems and re-certifying their access.

### 5. Revocation of Access

Access is revoked promptly in the following situations:

- **Termination:** Access is revoked immediately upon termination of employment.
- **Role Change:** When your role changes, your old access rights are reviewed and removed if no longer needed for your new role.

## Summary

Following this access control lifecycle is crucial for protecting our systems and data. It ensures that the right people have the right access for the right reasons.
