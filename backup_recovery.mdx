## Introduction

This policy outlines the requirements for data backup and recovery to ensure data availability and business continuity in the event of data loss or system failure.

<Note>
  This policy applies to all critical systems and data that support business operations.
</Note>

## Scope

This policy covers all production systems and data, including databases, application servers, and critical infrastructure components. Specific inclusions and exclusions will be documented in the system-specific backup procedures.

## Backup Strategy

### Frequency
- **Application-level backups:** Backups for critical applications and databases (e.g., MySQL) must be performed on a daily basis.
- **VM-level backups:** Full virtual machine snapshots should be taken weekly for disaster recovery purposes.

### Type
- The primary backup method will be application-level (logical) backups to allow for faster, more granular restores and to minimize storage space.

### Location
- All backups must be stored in a geographically separate location from the production systems. Backups must not be stored on the same physical or virtual instance as the application.

### Retention
- Daily application-level backups must be retained for a minimum of 7 days.
- Weekly VM-level backups must be retained for at least 4 weeks.

## Recovery Procedures

### RTO and RPO
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** The target time to restore a service after an incident is 4 hours.
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** The maximum acceptable data loss is 24 hours.

### Process
Detailed, step-by-step procedures for restoring services and data from backups will be maintained for each critical system.

### Testing
- The recovery process for each critical system must be tested at least once per month to ensure the integrity of backups and the effectiveness of the recovery plan.

## Roles and Responsibilities

- **System Owners:** Responsible for ensuring their systems are being backed up in accordance with this policy.
- **IT Operations Team:** Responsible for the day-to-day management of the backup systems, including monitoring, troubleshooting, and performing restores.
- **IT Security Team:** Responsible for auditing compliance with this policy and verifying the security of backup data.
