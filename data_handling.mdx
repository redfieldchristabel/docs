## Introduction

This section defines how data must be classified and handled across CARA COM MY systems.  
The goal is to ensure that sensitive data is stored, transmitted, and accessed appropriately to reduce the risk of leaks or misuse.

## Applying Data Classification in Practice

### File Storage & Collaboration Tools

This section applies to general document storage and collaboration.

- **Google Drive:** The company's Google Drive is the primary tool for storing **Public**, **Internal**, **Confidential**, and **Restricted** files. The owner of the file is responsible for configuring the access control based on the classification level:
    - **Public:** Files can be shared publicly ("anyone with the link").
    - **Internal:** Files must be shared only with members of the organization.
    - **Confidential:** Files must be shared only with specific individuals or groups within the organization.
    - **Restricted:** Files must be shared only with explicitly authorized individuals. Link sharing must be disabled.
- **ClickUp:** Used for task management. Documents related to tasks should be stored in Google Drive and linked from ClickUp.

<Note>
  **Exception for Internal Systems:** If an internal system (e.g., CARA HRMS) has its own secure storage for restricted files, it is not necessary to duplicate those files in Google Drive.
</Note>

### Version Control (GitLab)

- **Internal** → code repos without sensitive data.
- **Confidential** → private repos containing business logic or customer-related code.
- **Restricted** → credentials, tokens, or secrets must **never** be committed to Git.

### Databases & Applications

- Label sensitive tables/columns by classification.
- **Confidential** (e.g., user emails) may be accessible to project teams.
- **Restricted** (e.g., password hashes, private keys) only accessible by MIS/IT Security or designated admins.

### Data Transmission

- **Internal Communication:** Normal email (e.g., Gmail) and approved chat tools are acceptable for transmitting **Internal** data.
- **Secure Channels for Sensitive Data:** When transmitting **Confidential** or **Restricted** data, secure and encrypted channels must be used. This applies to:
    - **Email:** Use PGP/S/MIME encryption for emails containing sensitive data.
    - **API Calls:**
        - **Public-facing APIs:** All public-facing API endpoints must enforce HTTPS.
        - **Internal APIs:** Internal API calls between microservices can use HTTP, provided they are within a trusted network.
    - **Other Transmissions:** Any other form of data transmission must use a secure protocol (e.g., SFTP).

<Info>
  If you are unsure which protocol to use for your specific use case, please contact the MIS team for guidance.
</Info>

### Backups & Logs

- **Confidential/Restricted** → backups must be encrypted, with access limited.
- Use platform-level encryption where available (e.g., VMWare vSphere VM Encryption, or BitLocker for Hyper-V hosts) to protect backup files at rest.
- Logs must mask Restricted fields (e.g., do not log raw passwords, tokens, or keys).

### Access Rights

- **Public/Internal** → accessible to most employees.
- **Confidential** → limited to teams who need the information.
- **Restricted** → only MIS/IT Security or explicitly authorized administrators.

### Retention & Disposal

- **Internal** → retain until no longer useful.
- **Confidential** → retain as per business or client contract requirements.
- **Restricted** → securely delete immediately once no longer required.

<Warning>
  Data classification is not optional. All employees are expected to apply the
  correct classification when creating, storing, or transmitting information.
