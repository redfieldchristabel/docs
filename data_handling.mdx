## Introduction

This section defines how data must be classified and handled across CARA COM MY systems.  
The goal is to ensure that sensitive data is stored, transmitted, and accessed appropriately to reduce the risk of leaks or misuse.

    **Description:** Freely shareable; no security risk if disclosed.
    **Examples:** Marketing materials, public website content.

## Applying Data Classification in Practice

Here’s how to apply these classifications in your daily work.

### 📂 File Storage & Collaboration

<CardGroup>
    <Card title="Google Drive">
        - **Public:** Share publicly ("anyone with the link").
        - **Internal:** Share only with members of the organization.
        - **Confidential:** Share only with specific individuals or groups.
        - **Restricted:** Share only with explicitly authorized individuals. Link sharing must be disabled.
    </Card>
    <Card title="ClickUp">
        - Used for task management. 
        - Link to documents in Google Drive instead of storing them directly in ClickUp.
    </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  **Exception for Internal Systems:** If an internal system (e.g., CARA HRMS) has its own secure storage for restricted files, it is not necessary to duplicate those files in Google Drive.
</Note>

### 💾 Version Control (GitLab)

<Card title="GitLab Repositories" icon="gitlab" iconType="brands">
    - **Internal** → Code repos without sensitive data.
    - **Confidential** → Private repos containing business logic or customer-related code.
    - **Restricted** → Credentials, tokens, or secrets must **never** be committed to Git. 🤫
</Card>

### 🗄️ Databases & Applications

<Card title="Databases and Applications" icon="database" iconType="solid">
    - Label sensitive tables/columns by classification.
    - **Confidential** (e.g., user emails) may be accessible to project teams.
    - **Restricted** (e.g., password hashes, private keys) only accessible by MIS/IT Security or designated admins.
</Card>

### 🚀 Data Transmission

When sending data, use the right channels to keep it safe.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Internal Communication">
        - Normal email (e.g., Gmail) and approved chat tools are acceptable for transmitting **Internal** data.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Secure Channels for Sensitive Data">
        When transmitting **Confidential** or **Restricted** data, secure and encrypted channels must be used.
        - **Email:** Use PGP/S/MIME encryption.
        - **APIs:**
            - **Public-facing APIs:** Must enforce HTTPS.
            - **Internal APIs:** Can use HTTP within a trusted network.
        - **Other Transmissions:** Use a secure protocol (e.g., SFTP).
    </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  If you are unsure which protocol to use for your specific use case, please contact the MIS team for guidance.
</Info>

### 📦 Backups & Logs

<Card title="Backups and Logs" icon="archive" iconType="solid">
- **Confidential/Restricted** → backups must be encrypted, with access limited.
- Use platform-level encryption where available (e.g., VMWare vSphere VM Encryption, or BitLocker for Hyper-V hosts) to protect backup files at rest.
- Logs must mask Restricted fields (e.g., do not log raw passwords, tokens, or keys).
</Card>

### 🔑 Access Rights

<Card title="Access Rights" icon="key" iconType="solid">
- **Public/Internal** → accessible to most employees.
- **Confidential** → limited to teams who need the information.
- **Restricted** → only MIS/IT Security or explicitly authorized administrators.
</Card>

### 🗑️ Retention & Disposal

<Card title="Retention & Disposal" icon="trash" iconType="solid">
- **Internal** → retain until no longer useful.
- **Confidential** → retain as per business or client contract requirements.
- **Restricted** → securely delete immediately once no longer required.
</Card>

## Summary

- **Classify your data:** Understand the difference between Public, Internal, Confidential, and Restricted data.
- **Handle with care:** Use the right tools and channels for storing and transmitting data.
- **When in doubt, ask:** Contact the MIS team if you're unsure about how to handle specific data.

<Warning>
  Data classification is not optional. All employees are expected to apply the
  correct classification when creating, storing, or transmitting information.
