## Introduction

This section defines how data must be classified and handled across CARA COM MY systems.  
The goal is to ensure that sensitive data is stored, transmitted, and accessed appropriately to reduce the risk of leaks or misuse.

## Applying Data Classification in Practice

### File Storage & Collaboration Tools
- **Internal** → stored in company-managed collaboration tools (Confluence, SharePoint, Notion).  
- **Confidential** → stored only in approved secure systems (e.g., GitLab private repos, internal databases, secure cloud buckets).  
- **Restricted** → must be stored in encrypted secret managers (e.g., Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).

### Version Control (GitLab)
- **Internal** → code repos without sensitive data.  
- **Confidential** → private repos containing business logic or customer-related code.  
- **Restricted** → credentials, tokens, or secrets must **never** be committed to Git.

### Databases & Applications
- Label sensitive tables/columns by classification.  
- **Confidential** (e.g., user emails) may be accessible to project teams.  
- **Restricted** (e.g., password hashes, private keys) only accessible by MIS/IT Security or designated admins.

### Data Transmission
- **Internal** → normal email or chat tools are acceptable.  
- **Confidential/Restricted** → must use secure, encrypted channels (TLS, HTTPS, PGP/S/MIME for email).  

### Backups & Logs
- **Confidential/Restricted** → backups must be encrypted, with access limited.  
- Logs must mask Restricted fields (e.g., do not log raw passwords, tokens, or keys).

### Access Rights
- **Public/Internal** → accessible to most employees.  
- **Confidential** → limited to teams who need the information.  
- **Restricted** → only MIS/IT Security or explicitly authorized administrators.  

### Retention & Disposal
- **Internal** → retain until no longer useful.  
- **Confidential** → retain as per business or client contract requirements.  
- **Restricted** → securely delete immediately once no longer required.

<Info>
  Data classification is not optional.  
  All employees are expected to apply the correct classification when creating, storing, or transmitting information.
